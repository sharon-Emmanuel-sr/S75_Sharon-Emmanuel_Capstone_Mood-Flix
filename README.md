# S75_Sharon-Emmanuel_Capstone_Mood-Flix🧠 MoodFlix – Capstone Project Plan


🎓 Capstone Project Idea Brief
Project Title:
MoodFlix – AI-Powered Mood-Based Movie Recommendation System

Problem Statement:
With the overwhelming volume of content available on streaming platforms, users often struggle to find something that truly matches how they feel or want to feel. Traditional recommendation engines are based on watch history or popularity, but they lack emotional context.

Project Objective:
To build a full-stack web application that recommends movies based on the user’s current and desired mood, using AI, emotion-mapping, and public movie APIs. The goal is to personalize content discovery and enhance the user's viewing experience.

Key Features:
Mood selection via UI or emotion detection (AI/Camera)


Personalized movie recommendations using TMDb API


User authentication (JWT-based login/signup)


Watchlist & movie rating system


Admin dashboard for managing content


Dark/light mode toggle, responsive UI


Deployment with domain and live demo



Technology Stack:
